                            The film takes place on October 3 and 4, 1993 in Somalia, 
                            where a civil war is going on and people are dying en masse.
                            Accusations of genocide against their own people fall on Somali warlords who prevent the delivery of humanitarian
                            aid to the United States by a peaceful environment.
                            The UN peacekeeping contingent is unable to be on the territory.
                            Therefore, the command of the American contingent in Somalia, 
                            according to the plan of a lightning operation,
                            during which about 200 US troops as part of the Ranger Task Force (Task Force Ranger),
                            (75th Ranger Regiment - a company of the 3rd Battalion, 160th Battalion Air Regiment, "Delta"),
                            based on the outskirts of Mogadishu, should go to the area of ​​the city, protected by the forces of Mohammed Farah Aidid.
                            The purpose of the event is to capture the exporters of Aidid, who have gathered for a meeting in the city,
                            and deliver them to the base.
                            A successfully launched operation turns into a battle lasting almost a day and two downed helicopters.
                            An almost constant reflection claims the lives of 19 foreign and more involved Somalis.
