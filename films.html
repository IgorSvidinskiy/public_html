                            The film takes place on October 3 and 4, 1993 in Somalia, where a civil war is going on and people are dying en masse.
                            Accusations of genocide against their own people fall on Somali warlords who prevent the delivery of US humanitarian aid to civilians.

                            The UN peacekeeping contingent is unable to cope with the situation. 
                            Therefore, the command of the American contingent in Somalia is developing a plan for a lightning operation, during which about 200 US troops as part of Task Force "Ranger" (Operational-tactical group "Ranger")
                            (75th Ranger Regiment - a company of the 3rd battalion, 160th air regiment, Delta), based on the outskirts of Mogadishu, should go to the area of the city controlled by the forces of Mohammed Farah Aidid. The purpose of the event is to capture key Aidid supporters who have gathered for a meeting in the city and deliver them to the base. A successfully launched operation turns into a battle lasting almost a day and two downed helicopters.
                            Almost continuous fighting claims the lives of 19 Americans and more than a thousand Somalis.

                            The film opens with Trinity and Cypher having a phone conversation with green numbers running across the screen.
                            Trinity notices that their conversation is being tapped by someone, after which she deftly fights off the police who came after her and runs away from the Agents.
                            At the last moment of the chase, she reaches the ringing phone in a phone booth and picks up the phone.
                            The agent driving the truck crashes into the booth, slamming it into the wall.
                            However, Trinity's body is no longer there.
                            Young man Thomas Anderson leads a double life. 
                            During the day he is a programmer in a large company, and at night he is a hacker Neo.
                            One day, a strange message arrives on his personal computer: “You are stuck in the Matrix” (The Matrix has you).
                            An unknown person instructs him to "follow the white rabbit".

Snowden decides to expose the government's secrets to the public and goes on the run, seeking asylum in Russia.
                            The film portrays the personal and political consequences of Snowden's actions, as well as the debate over government surveillance and privacy rights.
